# SaveYourDickGame

My Fun project game for C++ training to get fundamentals of C++ syntax and workflow.

# Installation

<br/> You need to install C++ libs to compile and execute that for your OS (it differs for Windows, macOS, Linux). 
<br/> Once you are done just compile "Game.cpp" file and execute it in terminal of your OS. 
<br/> For Windows your can skip this and just execute in terminal (cmd/powershell) "Game.exe"

# Have fun! :)
